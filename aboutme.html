    <p class="aboutme">
        Aubrey is a writer, editor, and creative problem solver currently based in Austin, TX. 
        She is originally from Houston, Texas. Her interests include rock climbing, camping, 
        traveling, and doing anything outdoors. On the other hand, she loves staying home 
        and reading or having a game night with her friends. Aubrey has done a lot of traveling
        in her life, but the best places she’s been to thus far are Switzerland, Greece, and 
        Sardinia. She and her sister have always wanted to visit Japan, and she would 
        love to see Thailand for its incredible food, beautiful beaches, and elephants! 
        When it comes to food, Aubrey lives for Beyond meat tacos, and her favorite movie 
        is Into the Wild. FUN FACT: Aubrey broke her spine in 2021 while rock climbing,
        and she says it’s probably the most interesting thing about her!
